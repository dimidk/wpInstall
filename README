This is a script for multiple installations of wordpress. 
In init.py file you can declare the number of installations and the base installation 
directory. In passwd.py you define username and password and localhost to connect to mysql DB.
The installWP.py creates the database and database's user for wordpress and the wordpress's
files in the directory you defined in init.py file. 
createWPConfig.py, writes to wp-config.php, so the starting point in using wordpress will be naming your site and declaring the 
site's administrator's name
If you want to uninstall wordpress the uninstallWP.py removes wordpress directory and its database.
